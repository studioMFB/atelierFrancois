        <p>Here are two videos about the genesis of Another World, a video game created in the late 80's by a french guy named Eric Chahi.
             Originally released on Amiga, the game quickly gained on popularity mostly for it's amzing cinematographic qualities and it's
             transcendant  Sci-Fi atmosphere. Now iconic, Another World has since been released on many game consoles like my most favourite, the Sega Megadrive or most recently the Nitendo Switch.
             More impressively for me, is that Eric Chahi especially wrote for this game, its own programming language.
             Allowing him to draw the game's sprites (characters, decor...) with polygons rather than pixels (for a lighter game).
             But also to avoid using a compiled language like C. And therefor saving an enormous amount of time prior every run test.
              Indeed, you'll see in the video, that any graphical modification that Eric Chahi would apply to its sprites would instantly transfer to the playable game!

In the second video you get to see even more of it's artwork.
And you get an explanation of the creative process behind the animation of the hero and the intro scene, a classic!</p>
